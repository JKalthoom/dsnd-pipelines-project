# StyleSense: Fashion Forward Forecasting

Project Description

StyleSense is a rapidly growing online women's clothing retailer known for its trendy and affordable fashion. With the influx of new customers, a backlog of product reviews with missing data has emerged. Customers often provide detailed textual feedback but do not always indicate whether they recommend the product.

This project aims to build a predictive model using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to determine whether a customer would recommend a product based on review text, customer demographics, product category, and other relevant factors. Automating this process will help StyleSense analyze customer satisfaction, identify trending products, and enhance the shopping experience.
